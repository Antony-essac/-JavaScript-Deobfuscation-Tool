🛠️ What It Does

This script helps you deobfuscate complex JavaScript by:

    ✅ Beautifying the code using jsbeautifier

    🔓 Decoding String.fromCharCode(...)

    💡 Decoding hex-encoded characters like \x68\x69

    🧹 Removing packed eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d)... blocks

It transforms unreadable, obfuscated JavaScript into a clean and understandable format — great for bug bounty hunters, reverse engineers, and security researchers.
